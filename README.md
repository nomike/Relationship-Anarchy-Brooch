#### Assembly instructions

The brooch is designed to have a 25 mm brooch pin attached to it's back. If you have differently sized pins, just change the parameters in the OpenSCAD file and re-render the design.

For attaching the pins I had good results with a hot glue gun.

#### How I made this

I downloaded the logo from the URL mentioned in the acknowledgements section below and began editing it in GIMP where i was able to separate the colors into different layers. I closed off the open sections of the heart shape with the pencil tool, selectec thewhol heart, and enlarged the selection by a few pixels, which gave me the white backgrouund.

I exportet all layers as png images with black foreground and transparent backgrdound and traced them to vector graphics in InkScape, each color on a separate layer.
These vector paths I individually exported to SVG files, which I was now able to import in OpenSCSD to create the brooch.
